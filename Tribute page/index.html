      <p>Ratan Tata is a visionary industrialist and philanthropist, born on December 28, 1937, in Mumbai, India. He led the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012, and again as interim chairman in 2016â€“17. Under his leadership, the group saw unprecedented international growth through acquisitions like Jaguar Land Rover, Tetley, and Corus Steel.</p>
      <p>He played a pivotal role in bringing the Tata Nano to life â€” the world's most affordable car, symbolizing innovation for the common man. Beyond business, over 60% of Tata Group's wealth is dedicated to philanthropic activities in education, healthcare, and rural development.</p>
      <p>Through the Tata Trusts, which he chairs, he has contributed immensely to education, healthcare, rural development, and women empowerment. He has funded numerous hospitals, cancer treatment centers, and educational institutions like IITs and IISc.</p>
      <p>What inspires me most about Ratan Tata is his humility, courage to take bold decisions, and deep commitment to societal well-being. He is a rare leader who combines business acumen with compassion. His life has taught me to stay grounded, dream big, and serve society with purpose.</p>
